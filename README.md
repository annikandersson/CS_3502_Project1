# CS 3502 Project 1: Multi-Threaded Progamming and IPC

This repository includes the source code for Project 1: Multi-Theaded Programming and IPC for CS 3502: Operating Systems. It includes two main sub-projects:

* Project A: Multi-Threading Implementation - This project includes 4 phases that demonstrates the basic thread operations, resource protection, deadlock creation, and deadlock resolution.

* Project B: Inter-Process Communication (IPC) â€“ This is a separate project that demonstrates how processes communicate through pipes, specifically the use of pipes to enable data transfer between parent and child processes.
