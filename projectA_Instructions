4.1 Project A: Multi-Threading Implementation (Four Phases)

This is a comprehensive project demonstrating your understanding of threading concepts and synchronization. Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a complete threading implementation:

1. Phase 1: Basic Thread Operations

• Create threads that perform concurrent operations
• Demonstrate proper thread creation and management
• Show basic thread safety principles
• Banking Example: Implement threads for individual transactions

2. Phase 2: Resource Protection

• Implement mutex locks for shared resource protection
• Demonstrate proper lock acquisition and release
• Show synchronized access to shared resources
• Banking Example: Protect account access with mutexes

3. Phase 3: Deadlock Creation

• Create scenarios requiring multiple resource locks
• Demonstrate how deadlocks can occur
• Implement deadlock detection
• Banking Example: Show deadlock in multi-account transfers

4. Phase 4: Deadlock Resolution

• Implement timeout mechanisms
• Add proper resource ordering
• Show deadlock prevention and recovery
• Banking Example: Resolve deadlocks through ordered account access

Note: This four-phase threading project is a complete project on its own, demonstrating essential operating system concepts. While a banking system example is provided, you may implement these phases using any scenario that properly demonstrates the required concepts.
