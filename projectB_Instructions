4.2 Project B: Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

This is a separate project focused specifically on understanding how processes communicate through pipes. You may demonstrate IPC using either:

• Your own custom programs running in your Linux environment
• Existing Linux programs and utilities
• A combination of both custom and existing programs

Core Requirements:

• Implement or demonstrate communication between two or more processes using pipes (|)
• Show and explain data flow between processes
• Document your implementation choices and rationale
• Include your demonstration in the video presentation

Example Implementations:

• Create a custom program that processes output from commands like ls or cat
• Build a simple pipeline using your own programs to process data
• Combine standard Linux utilities in a meaningful way using pipes
• Implement a basic producer-consumer pattern between two processes

Documentation Requirements:

• Explain your choice of processes and how they communicate
• Describe the data flow through the pipe(s)
• Document any error handling or special cases
• Include example runs and output in your report

Note: While simpler in scope than the threading project, the IPC project is crucial for understanding how processes communicate in operating systems. Focus on demonstrating your understanding of pipe-based communication through both implementation and documentation.
